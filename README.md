Problem Statement:-

The absence of a centralized platform for filing complaints
impedes efficient communication between the public and authorities, hindering the
establishment of responsive decision-making processes. Additionally, the lack of an
interactive forum for collaborative issue resolution diminishes the recognition of lawful
entities within society and perpetuates systemic discrimination, undermining efforts to
build inclusive and just institutions.


Goal:- Peace, Justice and strong institution


Target:- Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative
decision-making at all levels


Inspiration:- 

The inspiration for this project stems from the glaring gaps in the existing
complaint filing processes. Witnessing the lack of ease of access to file complaints
and the absence of a straightforward tracking system highlighted the pressing need
for a streamlined solution. Moreover, observing the limited pressure on authorities to
provide timely responses underscored the urgency to create a platform that not only
facilitates communication but also fosters accountability, ensuring that grievances are
addressed promptly and effectively.
